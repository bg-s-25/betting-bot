# Betting Bot

Part of my practice with Python bot-making for Discord, the Betting Bot simulates betting rounds with Discord users. An assigned admin controls the bet options and winner of each round. When a winner of each round is decided, the bot allocates the correct proportion of coins to the winner(s). APIs used: Discord API
